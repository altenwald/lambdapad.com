# About

Lambdapad was an initial effort of [Garrett Smith](https://github.com/gar1t) for providing a web static site creator in Erlang. At that moment, I was searching for web static site creator because I was starting my blog adventure with Wordpress, later Octopress, and I loved the idea to keep generating HTML files instead of maintaining a dynamic website (with all of those threats), but Octopress, Jekyll and others were very slow and cumbersome for generating the whole website.

Lambdapad was a fresh idea, and a fresh start with my blog. I ported 300+ blog posts ([altenwald.org](https://altenwald.org)) and I was performing all of the customizations needed to fit all of my needs, but it was decreasing the speed more and more. Lambdapad ended out-of-date and almost abandoned.

In 2021, I decided to check the meta-programming of Elixir and the earmark library it has for generating the Elixir documentation for their libraries and I was amazed. It was even faster because it was running inside of the Erlang VM. That was the start of my journey with Lambdapad and I'm still writing and keeping it up-to-date.

For further information you can check the presentation I did in Code BEAM 2022:
